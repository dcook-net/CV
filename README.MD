<p>A passionate hands-on Developer, who loves building things, solving problems, and sharing knowledge with those around me. I’m a massive fan of simple code that is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to test, as this helps everyone move faster!</p>
<p>My current focus is around delivering AWS Lambda functions with F#. Prior to this, I spent 4-5 years building distributed, cloud-based APIs, using .Net Core & C#, Docker, Polly, MongoDB and AWS, along with several automation techniques to reduce the team’s workload. I was also coaching and mentoring more junior members of the team at CompareTheMarket.com (CTM). </p>
<p>I get a real sense of fulfilment from teaching others, either pairing or mobbing, or on a larger scale:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Over lockdown I’ve delivered several hands-on workshops teaching colleagues about Test Driven Development and Property Based Testing.
    <li>Prior to lockdown I have given technical talks at various tech meetups and at the local college.
    <li>I am also on the organising team of DDD East Anglia.
</ul>

<h4>Recent accomplishments</h4>
<ul>
<li>Design of build a library to Automating and improving our Load tests.
Designed and built a Python package to integrate with our Load Testing setup (Locust IO) to gather live usage stats on our services in Production (by querying Splunk) and automatically modelling our load tests to mimic how that service is used in Production. This package also performs validation and quality checks on our load test scripts to provide fast feedback on failures and ensure that no service endpoint goes untested. The package is now being adopted by other teams within CTM.
<br/><br/>
<li>Training our junior dev and getting them promoted.
I have been coaching a junior member of the team since she joined us on her final rotation as part of the graduate programme. When she arrived, she was thinking that she wanted to become a Business Analyst when the scheme finished. I took it as a personal challenge to show her what she could achieve in a more hands on role, working closely with her on a 1-2-1 basis. When the grad scheme finished, she applied for a junior developer role and joined our team, where we kept the relationship going. She has become a very valuable member of the team, recently promoted to Software Engineer, and we have set out more learning goals and objectives to get her moving in the direction of Senior.
<br/>
<br/>
<li>Delivering online training to Devs across CTM.
One of our Data Engineering teams were strugling to adopt Test Driven Development techniques so asked for volunteers to give some direction. I jumped at the chance to help get them up to speed. After figuring out where they were already, I put together a hands-on workshop showing them how we use TDD in our team.
This was particularly interesting to me as they are all Python developers, and at the time I’d had little exposure to Python, so had to learn the language to deliver the training in a Tech they would all be comfortable with.
After the workshop, I spent some time pairing and mobbing with people on the team to embed the new way of working. They now fully embrace the test first style of delivering code.

<h4>Work History</h4>
<h5>Senior Software Engineering @ I2O Water: Dec 2021 – Present</h5>
<p>Building serverless APIs in .Net Core and F#, using AWS Lambda and PostgresQL</p>

<h5>Senior Software Engineering @ ComparTheMarket.com: 2017 – Nov 2021</h5>
<p>Building and maintaining a large suite of microservices, running on .Net Core & C#, to power the backbone of the backend for CTM’s online quoting engine.
This network of systems needs to be highly available, deal with high throughput and fast response times to deliver a smooth customer experience, which is achieved via a combination of resilience policies (Using Polly) and automated load testing.
My responsibilities in the team include ensuring high quality code, taking into consideration issues such as performance, resilience, security, and the long-term maintenance overhead. It also involves a lot of automation to reduce the team’s workload and keep us focused on the more difficult and challenging tasks.</p>
Tech:
C#, .Net Core/.Net 5, Docker & Docker-compose, Mongo DB, Git, Locust IO (Load testing), Python, some exposure to Kafka, Bash, Linux, AWS, Splunk, Grafana, Swagger/Open Api
Techniques:
TDD, Continuous Integration, Automation, Agile/Kanban, XP

<h5>Lead Software Engineer / Tech Lead @ CompareTheMarket.com 2012 – 2017</h5>
<p>Promoted to Tech Lead of the Money team, where I had been working as a senior. This was a small team looking after just a few small projects.
However, the team started to grow, and more products were added to our list of responsibilities. At its peak, this team was maintaining software responsible for 32million pounds of revenue per annum and was soon used as an entry point for juniors; we would train them up and they would move out into other CTM Dev teams.

Success with this team led to a move to Tech Lead of the Motor Products, including Car, CTM’s most profitable product.

During my time on the motor team, I was also one of two people who designed the first iteration of BGL’s (CTM’s Parent company) first Tech Graduate Scheme, as well as overseeing the training and development of the junior developers across CTM.
</p>
Tech: C# .Net Framework, SQL Server, JQuery, WCF
<br/>


<h5>Senior Software Engineer @ ComparetheMarket.com 2011 – 2012</h5>
<p>Success of the CTM ‘Separation’ project brought promotion, and the opportunity to work alongside Thought Works on a new project to deliver new Money Products, while transitioning away from Waterfall and into Agile Delivery, and more XP techniques.

This was a fantastic opportunity, introducing me to Test Driven Development, Dependency Injection, Automation, and a focus on quality that I had never seen before.</p>


<h5>Software Engineer @ Comparethemarket.com 2009 – 2011<h5>
<p>Moved onto a big project to separate CTM from the rest of BGL Group in order to move independently. Complete rewrite of the quoting engine for Car and Van products using WCF, C#, SQL Server. Home insurance product followed soon after.</p>


<h5>Web Developer @ BGL Group 2008 – 2009</h5>
<p>White Label insurance web sites to provide insurance quotes from multiple different brands. VB.Net, ASP. Talking to IBM back end.</p>



<h5>Web Developer @ Lightstone Interactive (formally Pool.Net) 2003 – 2008</h5>
<p>My first job out of university in a small Software Agency, I started as a Junior Web Developer, initially working on some VBA front ends for SQL Server, generating reports for Alliance & Leicester Bank, and later working of the first online mortgage application process using the first version of .Net and C#.</p>
